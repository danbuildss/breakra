# Specshift — Architecture and Product Decision Log

Decisions are append-only. If superseded, add a new decision referencing the old one; do not silently rewrite history.

## D-001 — Working name Specshift
**Status:** Accepted as working name; clearance pending.
**Why:** Short and directly conveys API specification changes.
**Risk:** Existing uses of the name; verify trademark, packages, repositories and domains before public branding.

## D-002 — Independent repository
**Status:** Proposed; creation requires owner approval.
**Choice:** `somehow-internet/specshift` if organization and name are available.
**Why:** Isolated releases and security boundaries; not another company.

## D-003 — Backend before frontend
**Status:** Accepted.
**Choice:** No frontend in V0; agent skill and API docs are the interface.

## D-004 — One paid operation
**Status:** Accepted.
**Choice:** `POST /v1/analyze` comparing two supplied OpenAPI contracts. No monitoring or historical snapshots in V0.

## D-005 — Deterministic core
**Status:** Accepted.
**Choice:** No LLM or DB in V0. Prefer maintained comparison library after feasibility audit.

## D-006 — Experimental payment price
**Status:** Proposed for test; requires launch approval.
**Choice:** $0.02 USDC on Base per successful analysis, subject to verified SDK behavior and economics.

## D-007 — URL fetching
**Status:** Conditional.
**Choice:** Inline specs are mandatory; remote HTTPS JSON specs only if SSRF defenses are demonstrably robust.
